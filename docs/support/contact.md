````
Subject: Issue with RSI indicator calculation

Hi,

I'm having trouble with RSI indicator calculation. Here are the details:

**Environment:**
- Python: 3.13.0
- ProAlgoTrader Core: 0.4.4
- OS: Ubuntu 22.04
- Broker: Fyers

**Issue:**
The RSI values I'm getting don't match TradingView. I'm using:

```python
rsi = RSI(timeperiod=14)
rsi_value = bar.get_indicator_value("rsi")
````

**Expected:** RSI values matching TradingView
**Actual:** Different values (e.g., TradingView shows 45, I get 42)

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Create strategy with RSI indicator
2. Run on RELIANCE 1-minute data
3. Compare with TradingView

**Error Messages:**
No errors, just incorrect values.

Can you help me understand why the values differ?

Thanks!

```
